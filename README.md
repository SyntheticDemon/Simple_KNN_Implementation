# Simple_KNN_Implementation
a Simple  KNN Machine Learning Classification Algorithm overviewing the survival of a sunken ship's passengers
The implementation is once done by the known libraries of Python Language and once done (raw) from  scratch using the underlying mathematical concepts
The distance used for the KNN ALGORITHM is Euclidean
